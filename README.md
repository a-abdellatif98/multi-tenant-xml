# Multi-Tenant XML

This is a Ruby on Rails-based multi-tenant application utilizing XML configurations to handle tenant-specific logic and data. The goal is to provide a flexible architecture that isolates tenants while supporting easy configuration management through XML.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Ensures data and logic isolation between tenants.
- **XML Configurations**: Manage tenant rules and settings using XML.
- **Docker Support**: Streamlined deployment with containerization.
- **Rails Framework**: Built with Ruby on Rails for scalability.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-abdellatif98/multi-tenant-xml.git
   cd multi-tenant-xml
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Configure the database:
   ```bash
   rails db:create && rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```


## Usage

- XML files define tenant-specific rules under `config/tenants/`.
- Database isolation is handled using Rails' ActiveRecord with multi-tenancy strategies.
- API endpoints for tenant-related actions can be extended in the `app/controllers` directory.
